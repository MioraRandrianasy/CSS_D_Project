# Movie Data Analysis

This project aims to explore and analyze movie-related data, particularly films directed by Christopher Nolan, the percentage increase in the number of films between 2006 and 2016, as well as information about actors and film genres present in the dataset.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the power of data analysis in understanding trends and key information within a specific domain such as cinema. By leveraging Python and the pandas library, we aim to uncover valuable insights about directors, actors, and film genres present in our dataset.

## Project Content

The project contains several main analyses:
1- What is the highest rated movie in the dataset
2- What is the average revenue of all movies in the dataset? 
3- What is the average revenue of movies from 2015 to 2017 in the dataset?
4- How many movies were released in the year 2016? 
5- How many movies were directed by Christopher Nolan? 
6- How many movies in the dataset have a rating of at least 8.0?
7- What is the median rating of movies directed by Christopher Nolan? 
8- Find the year with the highest average rating?
9- What is the percentage increase in number of movies made between 2006 and 2016? 
10- Find the most common actor in all the movies?
11- How many unique genres are there in the dataset?

## Methodology

The analyses were performed using Python with the pandas library to manipulate the data. The calculations are based on a simple and efficient approach for each specific task.
